# salary_data
The original data came from US Department of Laborâ€™s Office of Foreign Labor Certification.  
I download them from Data Visualization and Communication with Tableau by Duke University in Coursera.  
Although I already used the same data and did visualization on my Tableau Public, I want to try in Python.  
This project is all about data cleaning and visualization.
